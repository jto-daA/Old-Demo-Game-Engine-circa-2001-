.plan 06 March 2002
Coding on engine to continue today after a laspe of a month or so whilst awaiting all neccessary hardware to arrive. 2 machines up 
running smoothly now, PS2KVM switch box intact. Each machine now has a dedicated purppose. Coding/debugging done on lowend machine,
surfuring testing on the other. Hopefully I will be able to fix the BSP compiler fairly quickly and commense hacking out some new 
feature in the engine.

15 march
I cant belive how simple an error held back dev on this engine; as a mere misplaced/mistaken variable name. But , thankfully, I belive 
that everything is fixed now with the compiler. Now I just have to try out everything and make sure that everything works.

17 may
BSP compiler finished. Commented out buggy poly-splitting code in favor of working poly-sharing code... Even on fast computer, the recursion ( perhaps unnessary ) slows down the execution... Next, to clean up the bsp rendering code, and begin on the next order of buisness.

21 may
md2 loader finished (*very* simple file spec ). Will add code for frame interpolation/custom rendering routines after camera code becomes functional.
  2037 Finished camera code ( I'm on a roll ). Comtemplating what to do next. Debating on adding bitmap/2d support and or adding quick DInput support; Light/shadow map
       code also a possibility. Realisticly, I could very well begin coding a game as soon as I get a decent level editor up and running ( which will no doubt prove to 
	   be a task most daunting ). Will do research, and start writing more fresh code TMW.

24 may
Engine coming along very nicely. Move code over to new project as a libary being used by the level editor currently dubbed 
"K3DLevelED". Working on adding DirectInput support beforing continuing work on the GUI definitions for level editor.
28 may
took a the weekend off from coding. Finished support for DirectInput. Next order of buisness, incorporting bitmap/scaleable fonts. I think that should be
all that is required before begining dev on the level editor. The only unfortunate things is that I ( and my computers ) are soon to be leaving, so I may have 
to take about a month away from any futer dev....

30 Sep.
long time sience I have added any substantially new code the the renderer core. Have decided to add support for mest/texture generation. 


20 Nov
Back coding again... Have a new system up with both VC++ IDE / 3DS Max 5... Let the mayhem comense.

Problem fixed. I guess it was just from being away from coding for so long and forgetting how my engine works... 
Can load fully textured objects now. Next order of buisness, loading animatons... 

31 nov
Reading up on the old 3ds dox to try and figure out how to load in the keyframe data... After this I think that 
it is about time to wrap up the engine and get starting working on the game that has been far to long in coming. 
On with the research.. 

04 dec 
work coming along smoothly ( albeit slowly... ). Finish loading in the global keyframe stuff, and am working on getting 
the track/object specific stuff out next.. It seems that there is a whole crap load of stuff in these files... I guess this 
is the unoffical year anniversary of this project ( so sad ) because some of the source files are dated this month last year....


26 dec
Havent have the motivation to code lately. But am back at work for the time being... Hacking out the keyframe 
loader stuff.. 

09 jan
Figured out a pretty big part of the file spec.. Workin on  yankin the stuph ota dere... lol.
20 jan 
back in the swing of things... Everything coming out nicely... Letting the code flow through ... 

15 jan
Got rid of the *one* character that had be stumped for a couple of days... Now the position tracks keyframe stuff is loaded in
Next I have to do the scaling and rotation ones, and the worse should be over... Thats is except for the child objects, which I really 
hope isnt that big of a deal because I feel some true progress on the horizon.

18 jan
I think that I may be pretty much finished with the whole keyframe business.. Those silly billies that wrote the file spec neglected to 
mention that the angle were in radians!!!... Time to do some test cases...

19 jan
Durn it.. There is something unexplained in the file spec that has me stumped.. everything is loading the way the spec describes, 
but the extracted keyframes are incomplete/inaccurate.. I am now sure how to work around this... 

01 feb 
Hmmm. Found a lead on the  keyframe stuff... As it turns out ( or so I've been lead to believe ), the rotations are stored as relative 
rotations ( not global ), and are in order to get absolute rotations, you have to convert the rotations to quaternions, and the 
desired translation is the product of 2 successive quats... I could easily just rip code to accomplish this, but I've decided to do some 
reasearch on quaternion algebra as well as some complex maths.... Code to resume in a bit.. 

08 feb
Going to start implementing the quaternion stuff today... 
----
Downloading the CG toolkit now... Prehaps will do some more foward thinking things, and try writing some simple shaders. 
----
Finished all the mandatory quaternion routines... Will debug them and try getting the rotations finished tmw. 

10 mar 03 
Hmm... Found some pretty interesting stuff today to do some cool reasearch on: algebraic surfaces... They are just what I have been 
waiting for. So, once I go on leave, I will start writing some *new* stuff, as well as (trying to)finish up the buggy quaternion routines. 

26 mar 03 
have written any more than 10 lines of code. perhaps this is a good thing. Got a new book.... Just taking a much needed departure from everything.

27 mar 03 
been hard at work on debugging the keyframe stuff. Have come to the conclusion, that my code is on the right track, it's just something screwy going 
on with the file format, that i am not sure how to account for yet. The angles ( for a consistent. angle increasing ,.rotation ) show up in the file
as defined by some trigonometic function. I am not sure if this is on account of data format ( degrees/radians ), or some kind of funky way the realative 
quaternions are used to encode transforms... Either way, I am away from my resoures, am will try moving on with the algebraic surfaces in the mean time. 
------
created the first files for surface generation. 

****************************************************************************************************************

21 oct 03
wow. no signifigant coding done for over 8 months... This is a trend that must stop now... Ok, back to those troublesome 
rotation tracks... 

21 nov.
Wow. Finally fixed the rotation stuff. As it turns out, I was mislead into thinking that quaternions were *required* for the 
rotations. After some serious hex work, and new online refs, I can finally move on and begin to make some real progress. 

25 nov
what exactly was I thining when I first wrote this code?!?!?! This is horrible... In order to move forward, the entire 
approach needs to be redone.... 

// 11 March 05 
Wow.. Almost out of the military now... And very little code has been written... 

// 03 May 05
Major lifestyle change has made it much easier to do productive things now... Such as coding :)
